  description: 'Making good videogames is hard. Allegedly, others have succeeded
    in this endeavour in the past. In their efforts to do so, they have written down
    solutions to common technical problems faced by all developers in the field.
    This course will lay at your feet the collective wisdom of these daring pioneers
    and help you tread the narrow path to gloriously performant games.


    This
    course is certified.'
